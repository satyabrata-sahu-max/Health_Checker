# Health_Checker
The Health Checker is a Python project designed for gym-goers and athletes. It calculates key fitness metrics, including Body Mass Index (BMI). Crucially, it estimates the Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) to determine calorie needs for maintenance, fat loss, or muscle gain, helping users manage their nutrition goals effectively. 
✨ Features and Metrics

* **Body Mass Index (BMI):** Assesses general health status.
* **Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR):** Calculates the resting caloric burn rate.
* **Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE):** Calculates maintenance calories based on BMR and the user's activity level (crucial for accurate athletic tracking).
* **Goal Calorie Targets:** Provides specific targets for Fat Loss (-500 Cal) and Muscle Gain (+500 Cal).
