# Health_Checker
The Health Checker is a Python project designed for gym-goers and athletes. It calculates key fitness metrics, including Body Mass Index (BMI). Crucially, it estimates the Total Daily Energy Expenditure (TDEE) to determine calorie needs for maintenance, fat loss, or muscle gain, helping users manage their nutrition goals effectively.
